# TabSurfer

Open source Firefox extension inspired by tmux. I have waaay too many tabs open for different things, so this will help me organize my tabs. 

## What is it
If you've used Tmux before you'll be familiar with this concept. You can name your work sessions, like "Calculus 1", "Cool Project that I'll never finish #100", "Job stuff", etc. Now you don't need the calculus textbook pdf, funny cat videos, and documentations on the same browser window. You can just save them with TabSurfer, and open one set of tabs when you like. 

## Credits
This was an idea that my friend [**Mahasvin24**](https://github.com/Mahasvin24) and I worked on (but failed) during a hackathon. I unironically needed this so I tried to rebuild it.
